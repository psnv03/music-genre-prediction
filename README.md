# Machine Learning Based Music Genre Classification on Spotify Data

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Spotify. It consists of a collection of music tracks with various audio features such as tempo, danceability, energy, and acousticness. The dataset contains labelled genre information for each track, allowing for supervised genre classification.

Preprocessing steps:
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.
- Feature selection: Select relevant audio features for genre classification.
- Feature normalization: Scaling the features to a standard range.

## Result

The project achieved an accuracy of 78% using the Bagging Classifier algorithm. Some key findings include:
- Certain audio features (e.g., energy, tempo) were more influential in distinguishing between specific genres.
- The model's performance was evaluated using various evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
